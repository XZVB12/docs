![Malice Logo](/images/malice.png)

Malice's mission is to be a free open source version of VirusTotal that anyone can use at any scale from an independent researcher to a fortune 500 company.

## Quick start

Install with `brew`:

```sh
$ brew install maliceio/tap/malice
```

## Features

- [single binary]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md#changing-the-color-palette" >}}).

- [plugins run in docker](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/08/quick-tip-css-only-dropdowns-with-the-checkbox-hack/).

- Many [database]({{< relref "configuration/index.md#database" >}}) backends to choose from.

- Web application capability on iOS â€“ when the page is saved to the homescreen,
  it behaves and looks like a native application.

See the [getting started guide]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md" >}}) for instructions how to get
it up and running.
