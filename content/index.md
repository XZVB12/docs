Malice's mission is to be a free open source version of VirusTotal that anyone can use at any scale from an independent researcher to a fortune 500 company.

## Quick start

Install with `brew`:

```sh
$ brew install maliceio/tap/malice
```

## Features

- Single [binary]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md#changing-the-color-palette" >}}).

- [API]({{< relref "api/index.md" >}}) first design.

- Plugins run in [docker]({{< relref "plugins/index.md#docker" >}}).

- Many [database]({{< relref "configuration/index.md#database" >}}) backends to choose from.

- Built with **cloud** in mind from day one.

See the [getting started guide]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md" >}}) for instructions how to get
it up and running.
